## Design Choice

- **Postgres**: Postgres for write-heavy operations.
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: Lightweight sync for book adds/removals/borrowingâ€”low latency.

## Tech Stack

- Python/Flask: Core APIs.
- PostgreSQL : writes for Transactional operations.
- Redis: Pub/Sub for sync.
- Docker: Containerized deployment.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up          # ADMIN: 8080, Frontend: 8181
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up  # Run tests
```

**Note**: I would like to state that i have 0 experience using python, the tests are not up to standard and i would like to apologize for that as they would fail.
